# Cinematic Wake

Cinematic Wake is an Android app that plays beautiful, immersive animations at meaningful moments of the day.

It uses a hybrid system of scheduled times and screen-on events so that each cinematic moment is actually seen and experienced when the screen wakes, instead of being missed in the background.
